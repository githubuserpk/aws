EC2 bucket access:
==================
There are 2 options, option-1 is not recommended due to security reasons, option-2 is through the role and is recommended

Option-1:
Step-1: Login to EC2 command line 

Step-2: run aws s3 ls 
output: 
error 

Step-3: run aws configure and provide the akid and skid and region values 

Step-4: now again run aws s3 ls
This will be successful and will return the bucket name output
output: 
2020-07-27 14:23:46 pkawsgcp-bucket

This is successful, but if you see cat .aws/credentials, gives below output
This is a security risk
output:
[default]
aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbcccccxffffff

Option-2:

Step-1:
Create a role called S3-Admin-Role and attach a permission called "AmazonS3FullAccess" to the role by doing the following

IAM --> Roles --> Create Role --> Select EC2 --> Select "AmazonS3FullAccess" permissions --> Next --> Rolename: S3-Admin-Role --> Click "Create Role"

Step-2: Now run the cmd from EC2 cmdline
> aws s3 ls
This will be successful and will return the bucket name output

output: 
2020-07-27 14:23:46 pkawsgcp-bucket
