ec2-isntance launch and connect with ssh:
=========================================

01. down the keypair (.pem) file from AWS.  Note .pem is the private key file

notes: 
Connecting to a running Linux instance using an SSH client requires a public/private key pair. 
Windows does not ship with an SSH client. PuTTY is a common SSH client, which is free to download and use. 
However, PuTTY does not support the PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) key format. 
The key downloaded from AWS is PEM format, so it must be converted to PPK (PuTTY Private Key). 
Fortunately, PuTTYgen converts PEM key files to PPK format. PuTTYgen is also free to download and use

02. with puttygen.exe open the keypair.pem file and save the private key file as privatekey.ppk locally.  You will use this file
to connect to the ec2 instance

03. Now, Launch putty.exe and enter the ec2 instance public ip and go to auth->ssh->enter the path to privatekey.ppk file

04. open to launch the connection and enter the user-id:  ec2-user on the command line to connect to the ec2 instance.

05. run the below command to get the instance a meta-data (public key)
curl -w "\n" http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-keys/0/openssh-key

06. enter below command to get the hostname of the ec2 instance from the meta-data
curl -w "\n" http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname
